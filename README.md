# Macros

All rewriten macros for AHKv2

The enterypoint is **hotkeys.ahk** - thats where ALL mapping should be done.
`lib` folder includes macros callable from outside, `scripts` folder has standalone macros

Most of the original AHK Windows and Premiere macros are from a deprecated fork of @TaranVh 's 2nd_keyboard repo. They are just too old and can't ever be merged back in.
